#Projective Geometry and Transformations of 2D

##The 2D Projective plane

**Row and Column Vectors**: Geometric entities will by default be represented by column vectors. A bold-face symbol such as _x_ always represents a column vector. In accordance with this convention a point in the plane will be represented by the column vector _(x,y)^T_.
